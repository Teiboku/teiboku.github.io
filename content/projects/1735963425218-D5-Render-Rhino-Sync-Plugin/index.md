## D5 Render
D5 Render is a cutting-edge, real-time 3D rendering software designed to provide architects, designers, and visualization professionals with a seamless and efficient tool for creating photorealistic visuals. Its intuitive interface, advanced rendering engine, and versatile features make it an excellent choice for professionals seeking high-quality results with minimal learning curve.

## User Case
Most users typically work with various 3D modeling software to create and save their 3D model data, which they then import into D5 Render for real-time rendering to observe the realistic effects of lighting.
In the architecture industry, frequent modifications to objects are often required, such as removing a landscape element or resizing certain features. This creates a significant pain point for users, as they need to constantly switch between the rendering software and the 3D modeling software.

## Solution
To address this issue, we developed a plugin for D5 Render that allows users to directly edit 3D model data in Rhino. This plugin enables users to make changes to their 3D models in Rhino and immediately see the results in D5 Render, without the need to switch between the two software.
