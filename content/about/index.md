## About Me

I was born in Shandong Province and grew up in Tianjin, China. After spending seven years studying in Nanjing, I came to Japan to pursue my PhD degree.

I'm a big fan of Japanese curry and Sukiyaki. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and listening to Japanese rock music, especially Blue Hearts and X Japan - two of my all-time favorite bands.
