[{"content":" 🌧️ CLIPRPN: 生成AI時代の新しい「雨」理解モデル # ― マルチモーダルプロンプト学習による雨パターン認識と除雨 ―\n近年、拡散モデルやCLIPに代表されるマルチモーダル学習の進化により、視覚と言語の統合理解が急速に発展しています。本研究「CLIPRPN（CLIP-based Rain Pattern Network）」は、この潮流を画像復元分野、特に画像除雨（Image Deraining）に応用した新しいアプローチです。\n🧩 背景：単純な除雨から「理解する除雨」へ # 従来の除雨モデルは、CNNやTransformerを用いて低レベルな特徴（輝度・エッジ・勾配）を抽出し、雨 streak の除去を目的としていました。しかし、こうしたモデルは「雨」の多様な形態 ― 霧状の雨、斜めの streak、水滴による散乱 ― を理解できず、テクスチャや構造の過補正を招く問題がありました。\nCLIPRPN はこの問題に対し、「雨の物理的パターンを“認識”してから除去する」という新しいパラダイムを提案します。\n🧠 モデル概要：CLIPによる雨パターン感知 # 本モデルは、OpenAI の CLIP（Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining） を基盤とし、画像とテキストのクロスモーダル表現を利用して、入力画像中の雨パターンを推定します。 •\tRain Pattern Encoder（RPE）：CLIPの視覚エンコーダから特徴を抽出し、「雨」らしさを定量化。 •\tPrompt Generator（PG）：テキストプロンプトとして「霧状の雨」「斜めに降る雨」「レンズに付着した水滴」などの潜在的表現を生成。 •\tDeraining Network（DN）：推定された雨パターンを条件情報として活用し、構造保持型の除雨を実現。\nこのようにして、モデルは“画像に含まれる雨の意味”を理解し、単なるノイズ除去ではなく、コンテキストに基づいた除雨を実行します。\n🔬 実験と結果 # 複数の実験（Rain100H、Rain200L、SPA-Dataなど）において、CLIPRPN は従来のSOTAモデル（MPRNet, DGUNet, Restormer等）を上回る性能を示しました。 •\tPSNR/SSIM が平均 +0.6〜1.2 向上 •\t視覚的に自然なディテール保持 •\t異なる雨タイプに対する一般化能力\nさらに、モデルはゼロショット転移にも強く、未学習のデータセットでも安定した復元品質を維持しました。\n🧭 意義と展望\nCLIPRPN の最大の意義は、「高レベルな概念理解を低レベル復元タスクに導入」した点にあります。 今後は、雨だけでなく、雪・霧・夜間反射など他の気象劣化にも応用可能であり、ビデオ領域への拡張（時空間CLIP誘導）も期待されます。\n","date":"2025年10月18日","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/1760784774221-clip%E3%81%AB%E5%9F%BA%E3%81%A5%E3%81%8F%E9%9B%A8%E6%B0%B4%E3%83%91%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3%E8%AA%8D%E8%AD%98%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F%E9%99%A4%E9%9B%A8%E3%83%A2%E3%83%87%E3%83%AB/","section":"Projects","summary":"A derain model use CLIP to auto routing.","title":"CLIPに基づく雨水パターン認識による画像除雨モデル","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"2025年10月18日","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/computer-vision/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Computer Vision","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025年10月18日","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/deep-learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Deep Learning","type":"tags"},{"content":" スマートフォンの複眼時代における新しい画像復元アプローチ 📱 概要 # 近年、スマートフォンやアクションカメラなどのマルチカメラデバイスは、広角と望遠といった異なる焦点距離の画像を同時に取得できるようになっています。\nしかし、これらの画像には視野（FoV）の不一致や解像度・色のドメイン差が存在し、単純な画像融合では高精細な再構成が困難でした。\n本研究で提案された DM³Net（Dual-camera SR via Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching）は、この課題に対して「多段階の特徴マッチング」と「グローバルなドメイン整合」を組み合わせることで、従来を凌駕する超解像性能を実現しました。 🔍 背景と課題 #

DSLR cameras can achieve various zoom levels by changing the lens distance or swapping lens types. However, due to space constraints, these techniques are not feasible on mobile devices. Most smartphones adopt a hybrid zoom system: typically using a wide-angle (W) camera for low zoom levels and a telephoto (T) camera for high zoom levels. To simulate zoom levels between W and T, these systems crop and digitally enlarge images from W, resulting in significant detail loss. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid zoom super-resolution system for mobile devices. This system captures synchronized W and T image pairs and utilizes a machine learning model to align and transfer details from T to W. We further develop an adaptive blending method that can handle depth of field mismatches, scene occlusions, motion uncertainties, and alignment errors. To minimize domain differences, we design a dual smartphone camera setup to capture real scene inputs and real label data for supervised training. In extensive evaluations on real scenes, our method can generate 12-megapixel images on mobile platforms in 500 milliseconds, achieving TA.\nKey word # hybrid zoom, dual camera fusion, deep neural networks\nKey Takeaways # Problem Addressed # Almost all upsampling methods (such as bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation, etc.) lead to varying degrees of image quality degradation. Consequently, numerous methods have emerged that utilize high zoom T images as references to add real details to low zoom W images. Commercial solutions are not publicly available, and academic research is relatively inefficient. These methods often perform poorly on mobile devices, are susceptible to defects in reference images, and may introduce domain differences between training and inference. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid Zoom Super-Resolution (HZSR) system.\nMain Contributions # A machine learning-based hybrid zoom super-resolution (HZSR) system that operates efficiently on mobile devices and exhibits strong robustness to imperfections in real scene images (see Section 3). A training strategy that minimizes domain differences through a dual smartphone camera platform and avoids learning trivial mappings in reference super-resolution (RefSR) tasks (see Section 4). A high-quality synchronized dataset containing 150 pairs of high-resolution (12MP) W and T images, named the Hzsr dataset, which will be released on our project website for future research (see Section 5). Methodology # Approach # Adapting to Imperfect Reference Images # We propose an efficient defocus detection algorithm that excludes defocused areas based on the correlation between scene depth and optical flow. By combining defocus maps, alignment errors, optical flow uncertainties, and scene occlusion information, we design an adaptive blending mechanism to generate high-quality, artifact-free super-resolution results.\nMinimizing Domain Differences through Real Scene Inputs # In reference super-resolution (RefSR) tasks, collecting perfectly aligned W/T image pairs as training data is very challenging. Therefore, previous research has explored two possible but suboptimal solutions:\nUsing the reference image T as the training target (e.g., Wang et al. 2021 and Zhang et al. 2022a), which may transmit defects from the reference image or lead the network to learn identity mapping. Synthesizing low-resolution inputs from target images using degradation models (e.g., Trinidad et al. 2019 and Zhang et al. 2022a), but this method introduces domain differences between training and inference stages, thereby reducing super-resolution performance on real scene images. To avoid learning identity mappings and minimize domain differences, we adopt a design where, during training, a second smartphone of the same model mounted on the photography platform synchronously captures additional T images as references (see Figure 6). With this design, the fusion model uses real W images as input during both training and inference, eliminating domain differences. Additionally, the reference and target images are captured by T cameras from different devices to prevent the network from learning identity mappings. Compared to existing dual zoom RefSR datasets, our design has significant advantages:\nSome datasets exhibit strong temporal motion between W and T (e.g., Wang et al. 2021); Some datasets are limited to static scenes (e.g., Wei et al. 2020). We have collected a large-scale dataset containing high-quality W/T synchronized data, covering dynamic scenes, including portraits, architecture, landscapes, as well as challenging scenes with moving objects and nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both existing dual zoom RefSR datasets and our new dataset. Model/Algorithm # When the user adjusts the zoom to a medium range (e.g., 3-5 times) and presses the shutter button, the system captures a pair of synchronized images. The processing flow is as follows:\nImage Alignment: # First, we perform global coarse alignment through keypoint matching, followed by local dense alignment using optical flow (see Section 3.1). Coarse Alignment:\nFirst, we crop the image from the wide-angle camera (W) to match the field of view (FOV) of the telephoto camera (T). Next, we use bicubic interpolation to adjust the spatial resolution of W to match T (4k×3k). Then, we estimate the global 2D translation vector using the FAST feature point matching algorithm (Rosten and Drummond 2006) and adjust the cropped W to obtain the adjusted image \\(I_{src}\\). Dense Alignment:\nWe use PWC-Net to estimate the dense optical flow between \\(I_{src}\\) and \\(I_{ref}\\). It is important to note that the average offset between W and T at 12MP resolution is about 150 pixels, which is much larger than the motion range in most optical flow training data. Therefore, the optical flow estimated from 12MP images is often very noisy. To improve accuracy, we downsample \\(I_{src}\\) and \\(I_{ref}\\) to a smaller resolution of 384×512 to predict the optical flow, then upsample the flow to the original resolution and deform \\(I_{ref}\\) to obtain \\(\\tilde{I}{ref}\\) using bilinear resampling. This method provides more accurate and robust optical flow estimates at a smaller scale. Optimization To accommodate the computational resource limitations of mobile devices, we removed the DenseNet structure from the original PWC-Net, reducing the model size by 50%, latency by 56%, and peak memory by 63%. Although the endpoint error (EPE) of optical flow increased by 8% on the Sintel dataset, the visual quality of the optical flow remains similar.\nAdditionally, we generate an occlusion map \\(M{occ}\\) using forward-backward consistency checks (Alvarez et al. 2007) to identify areas occluded during alignment.\nImage Fusion: # We use UNet (Ronneberger et al. 2015) to fuse the brightness channel of the cropped image from the wide-angle camera (W) with the deformed reference image from the telephoto camera (T) (see Section 3.2).\nUsing the source image, the deformed reference image, and the occlusion mask as inputs Fusion Process:\nTo maintain color consistency in the W image, we perform fusion only in the luminance space. The specific implementation is as follows:\nInput Preparation: Convert the source image \\(I_{src}\\) to a grayscale image, denoted as \\(Y_{src}\\). Convert the deformed reference image \\(I_{ref}\\) to a grayscale image, denoted as \\(\\tilde{Y}_{ref}\\). Input the occlusion mask \\(M_{occ}\\). Fusion Network: We construct a 5-layer UNet network, using \\(Y_{src}\\), \\(\\tilde{Y}{ref}\\), and \\(M{occ}\\) as inputs to generate the fused grayscale image \\(Y_{fusion}\\). The detailed architecture of this UNet is provided in the appendix. Color Recovery: Combine the fused grayscale image \\(Y_{fusion}\\) with the UV color channels of \\(I_{src}\\). Convert back to RGB space to generate the fused output image \\(I_{fusion}\\). Adaptive Blending: # Although machine learning models have strong capabilities in image alignment and fusion, mismatches between W and T can still introduce noticeable artifacts in the output. These mismatches include:\nDepth of Field differences Occluded pixels Warping artifacts during the alignment stage To address these issues, we propose an adaptive blending strategy that combines alpha masks derived from defocus maps, occlusion maps, optical flow uncertainty maps, and alignment rejection maps to adaptively blend \\(Y_{src}\\) and \\(Y_{fusion}\\). The final output image eliminates significant artifacts and maintains high robustness in cases where pixel-level consistency issues exist between W and T.\nThe Narrow Depth of Field Issue of Telephoto (T) # We observe that the telephoto camera (T) on mobile devices typically has a narrower depth of field (DoF) than the wide-angle camera (W). This is because depth of field is proportional to the square of the f-stop number and focal length. Typically, the focal length ratio between T and W is greater than 3, while the f-stop ratio is less than 2.5. Therefore, the depth of field of T is usually significantly narrower than that of W. Thus, it is necessary to exclude defocused pixel areas using the defocus map to avoid introducing artifacts. Estimating the defocus map from a single image is a pathological problem that usually requires complex and computationally intensive machine learning models. To this end, we propose an efficient algorithm that reuses the optical flow information computed during the alignment stage to generate the defocus map:\nThe optical flow information contains depth and motion features of the image. By analyzing the relationship between optical flow and scene depth, we can efficiently generate the defocus map without additional complex models. Defocus Map Generation Method # To estimate the defocus map, we need to determine two key pieces of information:\nCamera\u0026rsquo;s Focus Position: the center area of the image that is in sharp focus. Relative Depth of Each Pixel with Respect to the Focus Position. Since the FOV of W and T is approximately parallel (fronto-parallel), and the magnitude of optical flow is proportional to the camera disparity, which is related to scene depth, we design an efficient optical flow-based defocus map estimation algorithm, as follows (see Figure 5): Obtain the Focus Region of Interest (ROI): Obtain the focus area from the camera\u0026rsquo;s auto-focus module. This module provides a rectangular area representing the region where most pixels in the T image are sharply focused (i.e., the focus ROI). Estimate the Focus Position \\(x_f\\) based on Optical Flow: Using dual-camera stereo vision, treat optical flow as a proxy for scene depth. Assuming that in a static scene, pixels located in the same focal plane have similar optical flow vectors (Szeliski 2022). Apply the k-means clustering algorithm to the optical flow vectors within the focus ROI to determine the area with the highest clustering density (i.e., the maximum cluster). The cluster center is defined as the focus position \\(x_f\\). Estimate Relative Depth of Pixels and Generate the Defocus Map: Calculate the Euclidean distance (L2 distance) between the optical flow vector of each pixel and the optical flow vector at the focus position \\(x_f\\). Defocus Map Calculation Formula # The calculation formula for the defocus map \\(M_{defocus}(x)\\) is as follows: \\( M_{defocus}(x) = \\text{sigmoid} \\left( \\frac{| F_{fwd}(x) - F_{fwd}(x_f) |_2^2 - \\gamma}{\\sigma_f} \\right) \\) where:\n\\(F_{fwd}(x)\\): the forward optical flow vector of pixel \\(x\\). \\(F_{fwd}(x_f)\\): the forward optical flow vector at the focus position \\(x_f\\). \\(\\gamma\\): a threshold that controls the tolerance range. \\(\\sigma_f\\): a parameter that controls the smoothness of the defocus map. Occlusion Map Calculation Formula # The occlusion map \\(M_{occ}(x)\\) is calculated based on forward-backward optical flow consistency, as follows: $$ M_{occ}(x) = \\min\\left(s \\cdot | W(W(x; F_{fwd}); F_{bwd}) - x |_2, 1 \\right) $$ where:\n\\(W\\): bilinear warping operator, used to map image coordinates \\(x\\) to new positions based on optical flow. \\(F_{fwd}\\): forward optical flow from the source image \\(I_{src}\\) to the reference image \\(I_{ref}\\). \\(F_{bwd}\\): backward optical flow from the reference image \\(I_{ref}\\) to the source image \\(I_{src}\\). \\(s\\): a scaling factor used to adjust the sensitivity of optical flow differences. \\(x\\): 2D image coordinates on the source image. Optical Flow Uncertainty Map # Due to the inherently ill-posed nature of dense correspondence problems, we enhance the functionality of PWC-Net to output an optical flow uncertainty map, which describes the uncertainty of each pixel\u0026rsquo;s optical flow prediction. The method is as follows:\nUncertainty Modeling:\nThe enhanced PWC-Net predicts a multivariate Laplacian distribution for the optical flow vector of each pixel, rather than a single point estimate. It predicts two additional channels representing the log-variance of optical flow in the x and y directions, denoted as \\({Var}_x\\) and \\({Var}_y\\).\nConvert to Pixel Units:\nThe log-variance is converted to pixel units using the following formula—here, \\(S(x)\\) is the optical flow uncertainty value for each pixel. \\( S(x) = \\sqrt{\\exp(\\log(\\text{Var}_x(x))) + \\exp(\\log(\\text{Var}_y(x)))} \\)\nGenerate Optical Flow Uncertainty Map:\n\\( M_{\\text{flow}}(x) = \\frac{\\min(S(x), s_{\\text{max}})}{s_{\\text{max}}} \\) The optical flow uncertainty map typically has higher values in object boundaries or texture-less regions.\nAlignment Rejection Map # To exclude artifacts introduced by alignment errors, we generate an alignment rejection map by comparing the local similarity between the source image and the aligned reference image. The method is as follows:\nMatch Optical Resolution: Use bilinear interpolation to adjust the resolution of the aligned reference frame \\(\\tilde{Y}{\\text{ref}}\\) to match the optical resolution of W, resulting in a downsampled image \\(\\tilde{Y}{\\text{ref}}^\\downarrow\\). Calculate Local Differences: For local patches \\(P_{\\text{src}}\\) from the source image and \\(P_{\\tilde{\\text{ref}}}\\) from the aligned reference image: Subtract the mean of the patches \\(u_{\\text{src}}\\) and \\(u_{\\text{ref}}\\). Calculate the normalized difference: $$ P_\\delta = (P_{\\text{src}} - \\mu_{\\text{src}}) - (P_{\\tilde{\\text{ref}}} - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}) $$ Generate the alignment rejection map $$ M_{\\text{reject}}(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|P_\\delta(x)|2^2}{\\sigma{\\text{src}}^2(x) + \\epsilon_0}\\right) $$ Final Blending # $$ M_{\\text{blend}} = \\max(1 - M_{\\text{occ}} - M_{\\text{defocus}} - M_{\\text{flow}} - M_{\\text{reject}}, 0) $$ The final output image is generated through alpha blending and cropped back to the full W image: $$ I_{\\text{final}} = \\text{uncrop}\\left(M_{\\text{blend}} \\odot I_{\\text{fusion}} + (1 - M_{\\text{blend}}) \\odot I_{\\text{src}}, W\\right) $$ By combining multiple masks (such as occlusion maps, defocus maps, optical flow uncertainty maps, and alignment rejection maps), we ensure high quality and robustness of the fusion results, avoiding the introduction of artifacts, blurriness, or alignment errors.\nImplementation Details # Results and Evaluation # Experiments: # Results # Comparisons # Critical Analysis # Strengths # Weaknesses # Insights # Broader Impact and Future Work # Broader Implications # Open Questions # Future Work # Personal Reflection # Relevance to My Work # Practical Applications # Key Learnings # Related Work and Context # Prior Work # Learning-based Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)\nOver the past decade, various methods (e.g., Christian Ledig 2017; Dong et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2016; Lai et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2019a, 2022b, 2018) have demonstrated outstanding results in the field of single image super-resolution. However, due to the severely ill-posed nature of this task, these methods tend to generate blurry details under large upsampling factors (e.g., 2-5 times, common in smartphone hybrid zoom). Additionally, some methods are only applicable to specific domains, such as face super-resolution (Chan et al. 2021; Gu et al. 2020; He et al. 2022; Menon et al. 2020).\nReference Super-Resolution (RefSR) Based on Internet Images\nRefSR generates high-resolution results from low-resolution inputs and one or more high-resolution reference images (Pesavento et al. 2021). Traditional RefSR methods assume that reference images come from the internet (Sun and Hays 2012) or are captured at different times, locations, or camera models during the same event (Wang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2019b), focusing on improving dense alignment between source and reference images (Huang et al. 2022; Jiang et al. 2021; Xia et al. 2022; Zheng et al. 2018) or enhancing robustness to unrelated reference images (Lu et al. 2021; Shim et al. 2020; Xie et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2019b).\nIn contrast, we alleviate the alignment challenge by synchronously capturing W and T images, avoiding alignment issues caused by object motion.\nReference Super-Resolution (RefSR) Based on Auxiliary Cameras\nRecent RefSR studies (Trinidad et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2022a) have captured reference images of the same scene using auxiliary cameras. However, due to the lack of pixel-aligned inputs and real label image pairs, PixelFusionNet (Trinidad et al. 2019) synthesizes low-resolution inputs from high-resolution reference images using degradation models and trains using pixel-level losses (e.g., l1 and VGG losses). However, this model performs poorly when faced with real scene inputs, primarily due to domain differences between training and inference stage images.\nOn the other hand, SelfDZSR (Zhang et al. 2022a), DCSR (Wang et al. 2021), and RefVSR (Lee et al. 2022) treat reference images as targets for training or fine-tuning. We observe that this training setup is prone to getting stuck in degraded local minima: the model often learns identity mappings, merely copying the content of T images to the output. This leads to severe alignment errors, color shifts, and depth of field mismatches, which are unacceptable in practical photography.\nTo address these issues, we additionally capture a T image during training to alleviate the aforementioned problems and improve training robustness.\nEfficient Mobile Device Reference Super-Resolution (RefSR)\nExisting methods often consume significant memory due to the use of attention mechanisms/Transformers (e.g., Wang et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2020) or deep network architectures (e.g., Zhang et al. 2022a). These methods may encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues even on a desktop GPU with 40GB RAM when processing 12MP input resolutions, making them impractical for mobile devices. In contrast, our system processes 12MP inputs on mobile GPUs in just 500 milliseconds, using only 300MB of memory.\nOur system design is inspired by reference image deblurring methods for faces [Lai et al. 2022], but the problems we address are more challenging:\nSuper-Resolution for General Scenes: We apply super-resolution to general images rather than focusing solely on faces. Therefore, our system needs to be more robust to diverse scenes and capable of handling various imperfections and mismatches from both cameras. Domain Differences in Training Data: Unlike face deblurring models that can learn from synthetic data, image super-resolution models are more sensitive to domain differences in training data. Additionally, collecting real training data for reference-based super-resolution tasks is more challenging. Thus, our proposed adaptive blending method and dual smartphone platform design become key distinctions from the method in [Lai et al. 2022].

# スパースモデルのアップロードプロセスを自動化しました： 私は（または修正した）完全なGitHub Actionsワークフローと、特定の条件（model_type = Sparseのとき）で以下のアクションを実行するために必要なPythonコードを書きました：\n入力パラメータの準備（モデルソース、ID、バージョン、トラッキングフォーマット、埋め込み次元、プーリングモード、説明など） 自動トレース：元のモデルをTorchScriptまたはONNX形式に変換するか、両方の形式を同時に生成します。 埋め込み検証：変換されたモデルの埋め込み次元と機能が正しいことを確認します。 モデルがすでに存在するか確認：存在し、上書きできない場合は、アップロードを拒否します。 手動承認：重要な担当者の承認後にのみ、正式にS3にアップロードします。 リポジトリのドキュメントと記録を更新：アップロードアクションをMODEL_UPLOAD_HISTORY.md、supported_models.jsonに追加し、CHANGELOG.mdを更新します。 下流のJenkinsプロセスをトリガーして、モデルのリリースまたはml-modelsへの統合をさらに完了します。 使用技術 # Python GitHub Actions Huggingface

参考リンク # RFC by me\nPR by me\nBlog post by me\nはじめに # ニューラルスパース検索は、OpenSearch 2.11で導入された意味的検索の効率的な方法です。これは、意味的技術を使用してクエリを解釈し、従来の検索では見逃される可能性のある用語を処理します。密なモデルは類似の結果を見つけることができますが、正確な一致を見逃すことがあります。ニューラルスパース検索は、意味的類似性と特定の用語の両方を捉えるためにスパース表現を使用し、より包括的な検索ソリューションを提供することで結果の説明と提示を改善します。\n背景 # ニューラルスパース検索は、最初にテキスト（クエリまたは文書のいずれか）をより大きな用語のセットに拡張し、それぞれの意味的関連性に基づいて重み付けを行います。次に、Luceneの効率的な用語ベクトル計算を使用して、最高得点の結果を特定します。このアプローチは、インデックスとメモリコストの削減、ならびに計算コストの低下をもたらします。たとえば、k-NN検索を使用した密なエンコーディングは、検索時にRAMコストを7.9%増加させますが、ニューラルスパース検索はネイティブのLuceneインデックスを使用し、検索時のRAMコストの増加を回避します。さらに、ニューラルスパース検索は、密なエンコーディングと比較してはるかに小さなインデックスサイズをもたらします。文書専用モデルは、密なエンコーディングインデックスのわずか10.4%のサイズのインデックスを生成し、バイエンコーダの場合、インデックスサイズは密なエンコーディングインデックスの7.2%です。\nこれらの利点を考慮して、私たちはニューラルスパース検索をさらに効率的にするために改良を続けています。OpenSearch 2.15では、新しい機能として二相検索パイプラインが導入されました。このパイプラインは、ニューラルスパースクエリ用語を2つのカテゴリに分割します：検索により関連性の高い高得点トークンと、関連性の低い低得点トークンです。最初に、アルゴリズムは高得点トークンを使用して文書を選択し、その後、高得点トークンと低得点トークンの両方を含めてそれらの文書のスコアを再計算します。このプロセスは、最終的なランキングの質を維持しながら、計算負荷を大幅に削減します。\n二相アルゴリズム # 二相検索アルゴリズムは、2つの段階で動作します：\n初期段階 # アルゴリズムは、モデル推論を使用して、クエリからの高得点トークンを使用して候補文書のセットを迅速に選択します。これらの高得点トークンは、全トークンの中で小さな部分を構成し、重要な重みまたは関連性を持ち、潜在的に関連する文書を迅速に特定することを可能にします。このプロセスは、処理する必要のある文書の数を大幅に削減し、計算コストを低下させます。\n再計算段階 # アルゴリズムは、最初の段階で選択された候補文書のスコアを再計算します。このとき、クエリからの高得点トークンと低得点トークンの両方を含めます。低得点トークンは個別には重みが少ないですが、包括的な評価の一部として貴重な情報を提供します。特に、ロングテール用語が全体のスコアに大きく寄与する場合、これによりアルゴリズムは最終的な文書スコアをより正確に決定できます。\n文書を段階的に処理することで、このアプローチは計算オーバーヘッドを削減し、精度を維持します。最初の段階での迅速な選択は効率を高め、2番目の段階での詳細なスコアリングは精度を確保します。多くのロングテール用語を処理しても、結果は高品質のままであり、計算効率が著しく改善されます。\nパフォーマンスメトリクス # データ分布に応じて、二相プロセッサは文書専用モデルで1.22倍から1.78倍の速度向上を達成しました。 ![two-phase-doc-model-p99-latency]](doc-only.png )\nまた、バイエンコーダモデルで4.15倍から6.87倍の速度向上を達成しました。 End of Selection #
